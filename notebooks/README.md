# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that either generate or evaluate our models.

## Before you start

Before you start, make sure you have `python > 3.10` installed.

To be able to run the notebooks, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Every notebook has more information about the specific requirements and how to run it.

All of our models are already published on the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/nlp-group-6). So you can also directly use them without running the notebooks.
