# Scripts

This directory contains scripts that are converted from the python notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. The scripts are used to be able to run our code on Habrok, the high computing cluster of the RUG.

## Before you start

Before you start, make sure you have `python > 3.10` installed.

And make sure to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
